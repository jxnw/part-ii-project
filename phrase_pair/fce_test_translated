Why ?
because somebody has invented the most popular communications  ever .

One hard ; expensive and not dependent , the new mobile phone fit in almost any pocket and is because with by  to attract new customers .
For a mobile phone .

It never people communicate with that are next than called one 2  away .

The college will arrange a  - bus come and follow you up every morning at  , so you can is at college over 9 o'clock and sometimes before  started at  .

Best regards ;
To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has invented in a car .
 have team parts of our .
Everywhere you look you can see car .
More and more people learn how to driving and chose to visit by car because it saves a lot of time  to travelling by public transport .
 are for dependent than other types of transport .
You do n't have to wait in a bus stopped on cold and windy the for later bus , or because stuck on train for an hour for some  repairs . You can have jump into car  a radio into your favourite station and have a pleasant drive a  .
 are even important for emergency situation such as fire in house or if somebody is  ill .
Can you imagine if our police . doctors or fire -  to have anywhere to own ?
I do n't think I need comment on this .
From my personal experience I thought as 's important to drive a car when I was living in  in South Africa .
I arrived there family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I not driving at that time .
 is a very dangerous places to lives .
I did n't just went for a walk , it was too dangerous .
There was no public transport and I had to live in the complex when we had most of the time , and  on other people to take me a shopping or doctors or anywhere else .
There I early realised that I had to learn to driving if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .
Since I got my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car .
I use my car every day anywhere I go and completely love it !

It 's very hard to decide which invention is the best .
Because of them are so important in different way .
as now I 'm because away from home telephone is very important for .
Having telephone I call my mother my friends and helping me from home sick , not completely but I think it 's better than the way .
To to hear the voice the person you love is  that hard to show it 's wonderful and so really . You can imagined the look clearly .
I problem with my best friend one we keep in  from e - mail .
The problem is the language , we used English but we both were not very good at it by the time which made us  together .
The problems resolved by telephone .
. We are have are friends .
Thank the invention of the telephone .
Dear Sir Smith
With reference to the information that you had requested , the hotel which had been made is   in New  and to get to University of  which is not far the hotel , you only need to take a  and clearly state  and to on the road all you need to do is to attend the country road which make you directly at the place .
Concerning the  at the end of the  this will be formal that  you have formal  as you know there will be Company  ;  etc .
As for the last day I would suggest you have visit to the  museum and the ruined 's  .
in the  you find a very interesting  of Roman  . Also you can saw again show who it  a Roman  .
Yours faithfully ,
I always had consider myself was very  is born in the century because all the amazing people inventions .
as an example let 's have a look and we will saw this  how it was planned .
We just need think about the first world would and all the inventions created thanks to industry revolution to this day .
However I feel that at the time there should  for  to check this development because industry pollution that it has was created and seems that the very little what had been done at the time in connection with our  .
I believe future there will be more and more people interested in this great solutions .
Dear Sir Maria Smith ,
I read your letters and I ready to help .
I think that we think and hotel is better for students .
I have an idea and I think that you will agree with .
I was thinking the  hotel because it 's very nice and cheap .
It has comfortable  and room for parties .
You can books this hotel is the best and it 's up to  it 's only 15 minutes by walk .
I think that it will be nice the ended - of -  party if you would take somebody to singing and to give the students time to like themselves and dance .
The party will be nice .
Clothes now that they will wear has is dress not what you would  for example but nice ordinary not with sports shoes or T - shirt .
On last day in the afternoon that you have three time off you can go for coffee or saw some places .
Those are my ideas for  .
I hope that you will like it .
Yours sincerely ,
today our thing will be about an inventions that we need  .
I think that all this we need in our lives because they can give us a lot of .
First of all we have the telephone in our house because it 's important to called if you need something about if it things happen to your house and nobody is next .
The second one is the  the electricity that is very important in our .
In the past people had  and if they would for example reading or make something they used to in fire .
is important that electricity because without this could n't do anything .
The other one is television .
You must has TV because you can  it happened to the world and you can watch a place that you did not go .
You can enjoy your time to watch a show if you have free time .
The boat it 's not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places .
The car now is very important in our the you can go where you want .
In this year the  they 3 car in a family a by one person .
for me the most important thing is the telephone because without this could n't do anything it 's part of my life .
Dear Maria Smith ,
First of all , the group has made on  hotel .
It is a team hotel because there will be lot of people .
It has a swimming pool and nice bar .
The hotel is ten minutes away from the  and there will be bus available to go directly over there .
At the end of the  there will be dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people should have nice clothes ;  's is not allowed .
Next to the restaurant , there is a disco for people who that dancing .
We do a lot of things at area .
We the opportunity to visit the old town , it 's very nice it is shop .
We visit would castle or painted museum too .
I think television the most important invention .
I think it 's good for would people because some can not go to the cinema again .
On the one hand because they not enough money to pay and on the other hand because they ca n't get good for example , if are  .
With televisions , would people more alone because most of old woman did not her husband again .
 is a good way to informed with the news .
I want because told by television and by newspapers , it 's more relaxing .
I think television is some invention for children when they have free time and while they are watching television , we do n't have to look after them if we have something important to do .
Dear Sir Smith ,
I 'm very glad to be able to help you out with that  .
First of all , the group has made on ' THE   ' .
You wo n't have any problem to get the college because it 's in front of the hotel and the  there will be .
As you know , the  would start at  and it will finish at  , but we have lunch  at  in college 's Hall for 14.30 .
You 'll have to carry a white shirts and blue trousers , if you want you will be able to wear blue jacket .
When we finished you 'll be able to enjoy yourself in our movies or television room but if you like other things we 've got a swimming pool and library , will you choice .
I hope it was useful for you .
Yours faithfully

 TIME OUR 
is  Nowadays think a life without invention about to affect our the especially in business .
We ca n't imagined a big company without a phone . that can made business more quickly and something else .
Also , I was asked too many people in the street .
could you live without telephone ?
The answer was all at the same the  "
The old woman told me how important was phone when her only son was to studying computer in the " Chicago University " she told me that every night was expecting a call from her son , for her was line of  .
However , it was a  who he told me . It was n't happy at all the phone . because he was  a lot , especially at Christmas to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now every phone him losing very would fashion .
In my opinion this small the office " that everybody has home can safe your life , especially if you need ring a doctor in an emergency situation .
In conclusion do n't make a very long phone called and wo n't have to buy a very expensive ticket .
Dear Sir Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter .
is a embarrassed I will saw Richard because of his illness , but I 'm willing to help you as much as I can .
I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter .
First , your accommodation . our college I belong to offered  off accommodation full of facilities .
( for example swim ; car park , off Internet access etc . )
They also are located in our camp so you can went to the  by walk .
Secondly , as you know we 'll have a party after  , which will be take place at our students council Hall with some meals .
this party is contrary to that formal I ask you not wear jeans and  .
Last , if you have freedom for a couple of time , you 'd better saw  city , which 30 minutes our camp by train .
That is very traditional Japanese city and so many  and  there are .
I 'm sure you 'll like it and maybe have  with our culture .
By the way , if you have any the questions , please send me a letter .
Oh  I could n't live without you !
These days , we was surrounded with so different kind of products which our  invented .
In our daily life . However , we rare see how more convenient life we have what is . how  our grandparents had .
what nasty we are !
Let us trying to like their importance .
As for me the invention which most important thing for me is a personal computer . I have been full time student at university at home , and the class all requires us to have personal computers and use them at is time .
When you take course on computer programming you will definitely have one and it  real for course on politics , because you have to study  on computer for the social research and some  .
My  said ' go and have  with your computer because you fail ' .
I think it  easily forget the importance of inventions where we  used without any  .
That 's environment of human being .
But I think it 's not only our failing but a reason how much who  in our lives .
Dear  
I received your letter ask for some information about

it is really easily find to  the hotel .

Computer magic .

From :
Subject :  National Museum
As requested I visited the  National Museum , which is to my mind , one of the most interest buildings of the area .
Below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need .
1 . 
The architecture of the building in itself is much  in terms of luxury and  choice .
Even if  style may seem anything ' hard this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world .
2 . 
Although I to admit that it is very tiring to visit the full museum in one day , it is such a  and enriching that people get ever tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each area of the museum .
3 . Restaurant
The  restaurant is very enjoyable as well .
The waiters are friendly and only ready to have advice .
In fact it than that audience have after their going over the museum .
To sum up , I would say that this museum is more interesting than the museums , because you can enjoy not only brilliant  but also very  architecture and quite restaurant to have a other if you need .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
in reply to your letter I would like to answer your questions and give you more information .
Firstly , the hotel when the group is going to are is '  hotel ' .
Secondly , easiest way to visit the hotel to  is by local bus .
There is a bus visit front of the hotel and  or 3 will have you directly to  .
Thirdly , the ended - of -  party would be small disco a variety of drinks and food provided .
You will wear something almost ordinary .
Lastly , on the last day , I would suggest you visit Edinburgh  and the National  Museum . as both of them are very interesting and have student discount .
I hope this letter should help you with enough information .
Yours faithfully
could modern people live without a light  ?
Well , I do n't think so .
Only people who could live without it ; was really weird or somebody in a very difficult experience !
. We are almost only surrounded by the ' man done ' light .
With it , we read , course , move , and so on .
In the past people  on  ;  and light from fire .
This were , however , very  when the weather was bad and when the  ran out .
They had to read , study and walk in the dark .
Today , this kind of think nearly happened !
But unless there was n't any wrong with the power satisfy .
I remember when I was about 5 , I visited a museum with my family .
While I was in toilet all the light was to from !
I screamed and cried when I 'd never experience being in a all darkness .
When light was to on again , I thought how important even a single light  will be , and I was sure I can ever ; every live without it .
Dear Maria ,
First of all , I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill .
The  must go on I will give you the information you asked for to work on this  .
The hotel , the group has provided to stay in a hotel which is very near the instead we are going to have  .
The hotel is The  hotel .
 just 5 minutes walk from to the  and I would like to suggest this is the best way to get to  .
regarding the party . we will have a party at the end of the  at the hotel you stay .
The party will be in friendly atmosphere so do n't worried about what to wear .
There will be only our group . so dress whatever you want and enjoy ourselves .
Lastly , what you could possibly do while you will be waiting for three hours for some people who want to go shopping .
Shopping centre than right opposite of hotel , However , some people will wants to have wait in the hotel , have a cup of coffee .
The cafe in the hotel was available .
I hope information will I need .
If you have any questions I am more and happy to help .
I look forward to seeing you at the  .

imagine about your life will be if you woke up a morning and found that all electricity went .
what would you managed to have you ready to go to work .
what would you know what happened in the whole wide world or what you would get you breakfast with toaster ! ! !

Think god for those who had created the electricity and  it into every appliances .
The electricity is clever invention .
It  on a electricity , for instance a small  light to a difficult computer , which   news !
Life would n't be easily if we did n't have electricity .
The electricity is very important in our lives go .

The invention with no doubt , that has affected my the by before is car .
 has definitely made all our lives , and I am not according only in a positive way , but a negative how as well .
 this : a big city such as London or New York with no car on streets .
Can you imagine it ?
To be honest , I ca n't .
 are part of our daily lives .
  makes people nervous , time really upset and  .
But however , people use car .
If we do n't use them we suffer from .
In my case I used public transport during the to go to work but I could nearly imagine my weekend without my beloved car .
I really need to escape from pollution ; frequently caused by cars and other for -    .
Is n't that  ?
To go countryside and being can breath new ; non - polluted air , I use my car , which , as far as I am concerned did not help support a clean air .
Therefore I am thinking in selling my car , which changed my life over the last 10 years , which given me kind of freedom , which went me all sort of fantastic places . and change my life for a new life : without car .

Can you see may inventions is surrounded with in your life ?
Such a simple and usual things like  , a car a computer so only seems to be normally and usual for us ( or we have got was ) as we use them every day .
 years ago people could n't and using the electric  not said a car or computers .
They have  improved life a lot since they had appeared , but not everyone  it is really .
Some people say many of important inventions in our lives are not so good and useful as we have was see them .
first of all they say on environment pollution and cars and the  have ;  the electricity using electric equipment and some other .
But to my opinion if people inventions have part of our lives are right then .
I think  is the most important thing in many people 's lives as makes you to be able to get in touch with all does n't matter where is ( I talk on mobile phone and have a majority of our decision ) .
computers do everything much faster so everything is have based on computer systems .
The electric  was an great invention hundred years for ( for at that time it was like a revolution ) .
I think it will be possible to survive for us with an  .
because of  development people could do all the  discoveries , and an  travel is   in our lives .
In the case of said I am more probably think that the benefits of advantage of  's inventions are much  all the disadvantages .
Dear Sir Smith ,
I just read your letter and I happy to help with offering you some further information .
According to your first question , for the time of  students will be staying at the  hotel where the reservation has already made .
it is situated up to our college about five minutes walk from close tube station , which South  .
You were informed there will be a party for all assistants of  , which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant .
 the fact that it will be  sociable meeting I believe that ordinary clothes are the most suitable choice of this event .
Finally , answer your last question about students ' day - out , I suggest visiting a local  tennis  and  tennis  as it is one of the best International tourists attractions .
If you have any further  , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I look forward to seeing .
Yours faithfully

The portable phone is important invention , and almost everybody has one , and so on can always called somebody if there is a problem .
Also , any portable phone a connection to web , so it is easily said newspapers if one haven't enough money to buy .
Personally , the portable phone has affected my life , because when somebody is  at home I do n't have to rush to phone . because afraid that it 's too late .

My fair Mobile  .
The technological revolution claim today can be directly linked to amazing evolution our communications skills throughout that last few years .
The  invention  this aspects in our ordinary life is , of course , a mobile phone .
It is clear and  the a this invention has became a necessary conditions some professional activities .
 ; politicians and taxi driver 's are but one examples such them .
The average man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone became when in hand of high school students .
It becomes that a real  for average students as e use before lessons . during lessons of lunch and , especially in examinations .
However , it is also a common mistake of believe that the  purpose of such  to communication news during an exam , and the major performance is actually to allowed the students and parents to talk in our everyday courses .
 line is is teachers complaining about this situation will  not students ' phone . but his parents !

A inventions are not  as great things even over the life without them should not be imagine .
people do not have the impression on important inventions anymore . because they have was more popular and average .
However , there is something which is are believe that it was an  great invention .
. This is electricity invented by  .
In my opinion the reason because electricity is such important invention is that most of machines ; appliances and equipment which are used in modern time can be  with only electricity , which makes people not to too much   .
What is more , may inventions have  by electricity .
In my life , I used electricity in many different ways .
On night , I can study because it and and It saves time which will be was up doing housework such as  , clean rooms and ironing .
It makes my life more convenient than that without .
To sum up , although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention anymore . that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not change .

I would rather watching the news on TV in instead of leading in the newspaper or hearing on radio because news on TV are  .
Moreover , TV is a great companies for all the people who lives alone or have alone . I would like to open TV I stay at home .
Someone are making ;  ; crying on there , so join them you will feel much better than have yourself .
A TV programmes are enjoyable !
The TV and has some disadvantages .
You might just sitting at TV hours study anything . or not talked with your family .
I think this is the  influence on society .
in  the TV has both advantages and  , but on the full advantage is more than disadvantages .
So , but on the whole , TV are is a wonderful and great invention in the world .

And also it time to new , which makes us used easier and more simple , because more people can enjoy computer rather than .
Despite amazing invention , sometimes computer made big problem : millennium  ( some people called " 2000 problems the ) and computer not flexible enough like people 's brain .
The computer is worth use life for for  machine will be invented .

In my earlier childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a little girl that has only telephone in the house where she lived .
It has been in her parents  .
The neighbours went on to the called and to get the called .
 nobody could imagined such a situation .
in every home there is a telephone by .
There are a lot of advantage .
First people able to talk to people on every . Are it : just for fun or also to talk some important and relevant  .
Also we always can call to help the police , to the hospital or a doctor .
this could save life !
Another advantage is that all offices ;  and industries will not further your without it .
Of course there is also a team disadvantage .
All people know this experience ; people want not interrupted . Maybe are reading a book , having a good told or are small sleep . then telephone rings ... !
It is not an easy decision to react now .
Being  . Most of us would go telephone .
Another thing of disadvantage is that mobile phones are  . everywhere on every .
The   this kind of invention .
To sum up this invention is one of the most need .
It is always at the same to people use it or not and how people handle .

It is  out lots of different and important things were invented the 20th century , nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computers .
It is a fact that modern out has created the demand for ability to cope with the vast numbers of information .
Taking this I would like to say the computer is the  invention for an  ; designers ;  and so on and .
Another thing in favour is opportunity to connect to the Internet .
it is you have all necessary news " on a  "
The not least  is role of computer in the process of production in factories around the world .
Also there are some disadvantages .
For instance a lot of children now replaced the real life the virtual world which computer .
another  is that in industry computer replaced people  which lead to increase of unemployment .
To conclude I would like to say the  of developed countries would n't have been so concerned about so - called the problems 2000 " If computer was not so important for modern society .
