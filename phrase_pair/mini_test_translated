I hope he will  soon and that he will be to our  .
As far as organisation is concerned , sufficient number of twice rooms with shower or swim have made your group at the  hotel located through the the street the train station .
To come to our college , you can and look  to the lake front ( about 10 minutes ) or take new  car the train station .
The college than stairs away from the bottom end .
