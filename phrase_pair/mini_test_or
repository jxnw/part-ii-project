Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am sad to read about Richard not being at his best .
I hope that he will recover soon and that he will make it to our conference .
As far as organisation is concerned , adequate number of double rooms with shower or bath have been booked for your group at the Palace hotel located across the main street from the train station .
To come to our college , you can either watch downhill to the lake front ( about 10 min ) or take the new cable car from the train station .
The college is just stairs away from the bottom end .
