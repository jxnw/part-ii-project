Where are you ?
is very often the questions that you will be asked that answer the phone .
Why ?
because somebody has invented the most popular communications device ever .
The mobile phones .
One hard ; expensive and not dependent , the new mobile phone fit in almost any pocket and is because with by operator to attract new customers .
For a mobile phone .
communications has changed , not improved .
Of course it allows us to be given anywhere ( even in places you did n't wants )
for rescue teams , it is a great help .
But is n't it a handicap outside professional .
It never people communicate with that are next than called one 2 miles away .
It is not rare for two people walking part by hand , both making on the phone .
would it be better to preparing the shopping list than dialing home to put and salad to buy .
Mobile phone is a marvellous invention but as for cigarettes , we should right to it
CAUTION : a this device will damage a brain .

Computer Life
Now - day computer can be found in almost every corner in offices in shop .
And in cars and washmachines that were computer chips .
what has computer affected to our life ?
First of all , the efficiency of society has improved .
when shopping , we do n't need to waiting the Kasse to every thing 's note by hand .
when booking a airline we can have simply make a phone to any agency and get it given in a minute .
Secondly , than look up tons of books to get the news that we need we can very easily search it the Internet or on local network .
is a very often heard . that someone , who has a special illness ; has operations by foreign institutes which he have via Internet .
Also , with computers network , it can be possible that people work from home to make projects ; checking operations or having conferences .
Lastly how to media has also changed .
Instead of the tranditional telecommunication , we can talk ; mail or and saw together with the help of computer network .
Of course there were also some aspects of which computer technology need to be improved .
For example , leading on screen is still not as comfortable as on papers .
A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security .
Till now to very rely on computer is are somehow not safe enough .
In conclusion , computer have become very essential necessity of our lives , and it 's still a young invention , and need to be improved .

The telephone is a very important invention , which affected our lives .
It is a way for people communication although they are at two different places .
people use telephone every day and it is one of the most important thing in daily life .
In my opinion people need a telephone .
For example , a telephone is very important work life .
Now there are no company which do not have telephone .
Also it is god for people 's safety .
You can all the police if you are in danger or ambulance if you are injured .
People use telephone also for the personal .
for example when you want to talk to your family or your friends who lives far away .
Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone .
They are going to give and receive information very quickly .
this invention has made our lives easier and quickier .
The telephone has made my private life and and easy quickly .
It makes things available you do not .
Finally I would say that the telephone is very efficient for people .

The college will arrange a mini - bus come and follow you up every morning at 8:45 , so you can is at college over 9 o'clock and sometimes before conference started at 9:15 .

Best regards ;
To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has invented in a car .
Cars have team parts of our .
Everywhere you look you can see car .
More and more people learn how to driving and chose to visit by car because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport .
Cars are for dependent than other types of transport .
You do n't have to wait in a bus stopped on cold and windy the for later bus , or because stuck on train for an hour for some railtrack repairs . You can have jump into car tune a radio into your favourite station and have a pleasant drive a distanation .
Cars are even important for emergency situation such as fire in house or if somebody is critically ill .
Can you imagine if our police . doctors or fire - fighters to have anywhere to own ?
I do n't think I need comment on this .
From my personal experience I thought as 's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa .
I arrived there family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I not driving at that time .
Johanesburg is a very dangerous places to lives .
I did n't just went for a walk , it was too dangerous .
There was no public transport and I had to live in the complex when we had most of the time , and relay on other people to take me a shopping or doctors or anywhere else .
There I early realised that I had to learn to driving if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .
Since I got my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car .
I use my car every day anywhere I go and completely love it !
12th June 2001

Inventions has affected all our live !
Now , a lot of things are invented and make our lives are more convenient than that month .
A car is one invention which is very useful .
I think a car is very important to me because it 's very convenient for everyday life .
For example , I can travel may places in the U.K. In particular , I live Whitwell - on - the - Hill ( a village near Malton in North Yorkshire ) .
Can you imagine if I had n't have a car about I go shopping , to go college and and so on ?
In fact , is buses ( numbers 843 and 845 ) and go pass my village but bus fares is very expensive for me .
Also it takes long time to go somewhere .
The car has largely affected my .
I can go anywhere by car a lot quickly and used public transport .
I listen to the radio and sometimes can play Thai music I took any cassets me from Thailand .
I took a car driving theory test last October and in and I will have a do driving test very quickly .
I think I have to drive the car myself so it will learn more about the advantages to play the car .
In conclusion , I think car is very important to me and it has affected my .
If I have more money I will buy again car . I think it have more advantages than disadvantages .
So , we would say may thanks to who invented a car !

Invented Light
There are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight ; moonlight ; candle light .
Some of them are nature whereas the others are not .
Owing to increase demand of light for more activities the natural source is not sufficient .
Therefore , electric light has invented .
Nowadays , electric light has becoming part of our lives . In particular during the night .
Whatever we do at night , we need the electric light .
Have you ever imaged about this world will be if there were no electric light ?
It will has been a team impact on industry ; agriculture and our lifestyle .
Think about the electricity your home a went circuit .
do you have badly ?

Yours faithfully ,
I always had consider myself was very looky is born in the century because all the amazing people inventions .
as an example let 's have a look and we will saw this nation how it was planned .
We just need think about the first world would and all the inventions created thanks to industry revolution to this day .
However I feel that at the time there should emerge for grups to check this development because industry pollution that it has was created and seems that the very little what had been done at the time in connection with our embiroment .
I believe future there will be more and more people interested in this great solutions .
Dear Sir Maria Smith ,
I read your letters and I ready to help .
I think that we think and hotel is better for students .
I have an idea and I think that you will agree with .
I was thinking the Palace hotel because it 's very nice and cheap .
It has comfortable bedrooms and room for parties .
You can books this hotel is the best and it 's up to conference it 's only 15 minutes by walk .
I think that it will be nice the ended - of - conference party if you would take somebody to singing and to give the students time to like themselves and dance .
The party will be nice .
Clothes now that they will wear has is dress not what you would casino for example but nice ordinary not with sports shoes or T - shirt .
On last day in the afternoon that you have three time off you can go for coffee or saw some places .
Those are my ideas for conference .
I hope that you will like it .
Yours sincerely ,
today our thing will be about an inventions that we need inour .
I think that all this we need in our lives because they can give us a lot of .
First of all we have the telephone in our house because it 's important to called if you need something about if it things happen to your house and nobody is next .
The second one is the lamp the electricity that is very important in our .
In the past people had electicity and if they would for example reading or make something they used to in fire .
is important that electricity because without this could n't do anything .
The other one is television .
You must has TV because you can liten it happened to the world and you can watch a place that you did not go .
You can enjoy your time to watch a show if you have free time .
The boat it 's not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places .
The car now is very important in our the you can go where you want .
In this year the familys they 3 car in a family a by one person .
for me the most important thing is the telephone because without this could n't do anything it 's part of my life .
Dear Maria Smith ,
First of all , the group has made on Palace hotel .
It is a team hotel because there will be lot of people .
It has a swimming pool and nice bar .
The hotel is ten minutes away from the conference and there will be bus available to go directly over there .
At the end of the conference there will be dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people should have nice clothes ; jean 's is not allowed .
Next to the restaurant , there is a disco for people who that dancing .
We do a lot of things at area .
We the opportunity to visit the old town , it 's very nice it is shop .
We visit would castle or painted museum too .
I think television the most important invention .
I think it 's good for would people because some can not go to the cinema again .
On the one hand because they not enough money to pay and on the other hand because they ca n't get good for example , if are disabled .
With televisions , would people more alone because most of old woman did not her husband again .
Television is a good way to informed with the news .
I want because told by television and by newspapers , it 's more relaxing .
I think television is some invention for children when they have free time and while they are watching television , we do n't have to look after them if we have something important to do .
Dear Sir Smith ,
I 'm very glad to be able to help you out with that sutiation .
First of all , the group has made on ' THE PALACE HOTEL ' .
You wo n't have any problem to get the college because it 's in front of the hotel and the conference there will be .
As you know , the conference would start at 11:00 and it will finish at 13:00 , but we have lunch altogether at 13:30 in college 's Hall for 14.30 .
You 'll have to carry a white shirts and blue trousers , if you want you will be able to wear blue jacket .
When we finished you 'll be able to enjoy yourself in our movies or television room but if you like other things we 've got a swimming pool and library , will you choice .
I hope it was useful for you .

TELEPHONE TIME OUR LIFES
is imposible Nowadays think a life without invention about to affect our the especially in business .
We ca n't imagined a big company without a phone . that can made business more quickly and something else .
Also , I was asked too many people in the street .
could you live without telephone ?
The answer was all at the same the Imposible "
The old woman told me how important was phone when her only son was to studying computer in the " Chicago University " she told me that every night was expecting a call from her son , for her was line of hapiness .
However , it was a persone who he told me . It was n't happy at all the phone . because he was writte a lot , especially at Christmas to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now every phone him losing very would fashion .
In my opinion this small the office " that everybody has home can safe your life , especially if you need ring a doctor in an emergency situation .
In conclusion do n't make a very long phone called and wo n't have to buy a very expensive ticket .
Dear Sir Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter .
is a embarrassed I will saw Richard because of his illness , but I 'm willing to help you as much as I can .
I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter .
First , your accommodation . our college I belong to offered visitor off accommodation full of facilities .
( for example swim ; car park , off Internet access etc . )
They also are located in our camp so you can went to the conference by walk .
Secondly , as you know we 'll have a party after conference , which will be take place at our students council Hall with some meals .
this party is contrary to that formal I ask you not wear jeans and trainners .
Last , if you have freedom for a couple of time , you 'd better saw Kamakura city , which 30 minutes our camp by train .
That is very traditional Japanese city and so many temple and heritages there are .
I 'm sure you 'll like it and maybe have familier with our culture .
By the way , if you have any the questions , please send me a letter .
Oh Baby I could n't live without you !
These days , we was surrounded with so different kind of products which our ancestors invented .
In our daily life . However , we rare see how more convenient life we have what is . how inconvinient our grandparents had .
what nasty we are !
Let us trying to like their importance .
As for me the invention which most important thing for me is a personal computer . I have been full time student at university at home , and the class all requires us to have personal computers and use them at is time .
When you take course on computer programming you will definitely have one and it holds real for course on politics , because you have to study statistic on computer for the social research and some analysys .
My professor said ' go and have familier with your computer because you fail ' .
I think it amazingly easily forget the importance of inventions where we useually used without any questione .
That 's environment of human being .
But I think it 's not only our failing but a reason how much who integrate in our lives .

To : ( group leader )
From :
Subject : Bournemouth National Museum
As requested I visited the Bournemouth National Museum , which is to my mind , one of the most interest buildings of the area .
Below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need .
1 . Architecture
The architecture of the building in itself is much breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice .
Even if architectural style may seem anything ' hard this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world .
2 . Exposition
Although I to admit that it is very tiring to visit the full museum in one day , it is such a rewarding and enriching that people get ever tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each area of the museum .
3 . Restaurant
The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well .
The waiters are friendly and only ready to have advice .
In fact it than that audience have after their going over the museum .
To sum up , I would say that this museum is more interesting than the museums , because you can enjoy not only brilliant masterpieces but also very uncommon architecture and quite restaurant to have a other if you need .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
in reply to your letter I would like to answer your questions and give you more information .
Firstly , the hotel when the group is going to are is ' Palace hotel ' .
Secondly , easiest way to visit the hotel to conference is by local bus .
There is a bus visit front of the hotel and no.31 or 3 will have you directly to conference .
Thirdly , the ended - of - conference party would be small disco a variety of drinks and food provided .
You will wear something almost ordinary .
Lastly , on the last day , I would suggest you visit Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum . as both of them are very interesting and have student discount .
I hope this letter should help you with enough information .
Yours faithfully
could modern people live without a light bulb ?
Well , I do n't think so .
Only people who could live without it ; was really weird or somebody in a very difficult experience !
. We are almost only surrounded by the ' man done ' light .
With it , we read , course , move , and so on .
In the past people relied on sunlight ; moonlight and light from fire .
This were , however , very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out .
They had to read , study and walk in the dark .
Today , this kind of think nearly happened !
But unless there was n't any wrong with the power satisfy .

The invention of the car was great point in history .
For there on people was mobile and travel where they wanted .

In my life in the car has really influence . I come a rural area .
Next city is 15 km away and there is no acceptable bus - or rail connection there .
It has been quite hard to me not to have opportunities my freedom like my friends that lived in or near the city .

I always asked my Mom or my Dad to where I wanted to go .
Today I have my own cars and I use it day to get to work and to meet my friends at any places and any time .
So with my car I got a great freedom .

Inventions has affected all our live !
what it is it we spend all day may time ?
Sometimes 's early in the morning late in the evening .
yes is the TV .
it is well - known in almost all family often with a lot of the cannels .
First of all , the TV can tell us information for a short time what happened all over the world .
Another thing in favour of the invention for TV is that who giving interest reports , for instance on population or different cultures from other countries .
However they have a lot different programme usually something everybody .
It would be and relaxing to enter on sofa after busy day at work .
Finally , TV is in my opinion very useful for have great information you can watching the weather and all of them were show in brilliant colour .
To sum up , in my opinion the TV is a very good and useful invention .
However , they sent a lots of violence which is not good for the children .
I can not imagine living without televison is something that we need for our education . to get news and the help information .
Dear Sir Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
Surely I 'll try to help you as good as I can .
First , I tell you the name of the hotel , it 's Palace hotel .

regarding the ended - of - conference party I can only say a band will be playing the full night , and a special guest I still do n't know will be expected .
I suggest when ordinary clothes I think there 's no need to school uniform .
To answer your last question I would offer you meet the local zoo , because many money population were born in the few days .
Dear Sir Smith , I hope the because information is useful for you .
I 'm looking forward to see you at the conference .
Yours faithfully
The telephone

The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell at the end of the 19th century .
It was an invention nobody though how important and how widespread would be in future .
Now almost every home in western world own a telephone and calling relatives or friends share all over the world is no strange thing .
people have the telephone not only for chat , but also for exchanging information on very went and directly how the opportunity to question immediately .
When I was a child we had no telephone at home , and I always had to a phone office in the centre of our village .
Now I have my flat , and first piece of furniture I bought was telephone . I 'll never take it away from my home .

Palace hotel is opposite the park ' Clifton ' , which is near the college .
we taken that hotel because it is it near the college and we do n't need to uses a transport .
Because you know where is college and you need to bring with me something at college to hotel I think that is better went all group in college and then we can go all together to ' Palace hotel ' .
The conference starts at 9:00 o'clock you need to at the college half an hour before .
Concerning the ended - of - conference I think for some dance and singing event .
Tell me your idea .
regarding the clothes that we need to wear ; was uniform because it is the most conference to London and every year came lectures from other colleagues .

. this kind of facility has made our lives more comfortable and easy .
In fact we can go anywhere sitting and with friends or with our family and carrying lugguage and shopping bags .
Cars are able to included not only went distance but also can be used for long journey .
For example , in the past would had really exhausting travel going a hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of optionals to live .
However , I have to say that it . people will be lazy and at the same time stressed is traffic .
Also one of the main advantage is that we can save time and money as car has long last and allowe us travel quickly .
That 's why I not image my life without .

The Telephone : A great invention .
imagine your life without a telephone .
Yes , I know it is just hard to imagine our live without this invention .
Think about the people living of the time was invented .
must had a exciting thing being able to talk to one life thousands of miles for ........ and now for us is just as simple as dial a number and talk to whoever we want .
Of course is nice to a phone conversation with friends or family but telephone is very important for business and emergencies .
For example , I work for a bank , and we need to weekly meetings with our Director life 800 kilometres before , and he do n't have to see the show , we just a phone conference and everybody can talks , and that is it !
what is emergencies ?
A phone call in time for an ambulance can save the lives of many people have a heard attack .
We sometimes do n't realize the importance of any inventions we use in our everyday life .
but know .... that will we do without them !

INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES !
The invention with no doubt , that has affected my the by before is car .
Cars has definitely made all our lives , and I am not according only in a positive way , but a negative how as well .
Picture this : a big city such as London or New York with no car on streets .
Can you imagine it ?
To be honest , I ca n't .
Cars are part of our daily lives .
Traffic jams makes people nervous , time really upset and violent .
But however , people use car .
If we do n't use them we suffer from .
In my case I used public transport during the to go to work but I could nearly imagine my weekend without my beloved car .
I really need to escape from pollution ; frequently caused by cars and other for - wheel motored vehicle .
Is n't that contradictorious ?
To go countryside and being can breath new ; non - polluted air , I use my car , which , as far as I am concerned did not help support a clean air .
Therefore I am thinking in selling my car , which changed my life over the last 10 years , which given me kind of freedom , which went me all sort of fantastic places . and change my life for a new life : without car .
Dear Sir Smith .
I have just received your .

Can you see may inventions is surrounded with in your life ?
Such a simple and usual things like telefone , a car a computer so only seems to be normally and usual for us ( or we have got was ) as we use them every day .
Hundred years ago people could n't and using the electric lump not said a car or computers .
They have intentions improved life a lot since they had appeared , but not everyone beleives it is really .
Some people say many of important inventions in our lives are not so good and useful as we have was see them .
first of all they say on environment pollution and cars and the vechicles have ; overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some other .
But to my opinion if people inventions have part of our lives are right then .
I think telefone is the most important thing in many people 's lives as makes you to be able to get in touch with all does n't matter where is ( I talk on mobile phone and have a majority of our decision ) .
computers do everything much faster so everything is have based on computer systems .
The electric lamp was an great invention hundred years for ( for at that time it was like a revolution ) .
I think it will be possible to survive for us with an eclectric .
because of shipbuilding development people could do all the geographical discoveries , and an automobile travel is undenyable neccecerity in our lives .
In the case of said I am more probably think that the benefits of advantage of peopel 's inventions are much higre all the disadvantages .
Dear Sir Smith ,
I just read your letter and I happy to help with offering you some further information .
According to your first question , for the time of conference students will be staying at the Palace hotel where the reservation has already made .
it is situated up to our college about five minutes walk from close tube station , which South Wimbledon .
You were informed there will be a party for all assistants of conference , which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant .
Minding the fact that it will be entirely sociable meeting I believe that ordinary clothes are the most suitable choice of this event .
Finally , answer your last question about students ' day - out , I suggest visiting a local Lawn tennis Museums and Wimbledon tennis Courts as it is one of the best International tourists attractions .
If you have any further questione , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I look forward to seeing .
Yours faithfully

Dear Madam ,
I received your letter and I was pleased to answer your questions .

Afterwards you will have any time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland .
If you have any more questions , write back .
Yours faithfully
I will write the invention of the computer .
With computer our work is easy and more interest .

When they will right news , they had to write the full letter .
With computer we write a letter ; right news or changes called with written that the full letter . we raise the letter and for three week we could send to another person .
I worked at a bank and I work all day with computers .
If we hand't ay one we say all transactions on papers .
I than money our bank the computer I can be sure that I arrive the day after .

The portable phone . very need invention !
All mankind history , the discovers who tried to have living better but it is last centuries that there were a biggest innovations made .
When phone with cable was invented one was n't sure if it would be a success or not .
But research went on and the portable phone is have only lower and more useful .
The portable phone is important invention , and almost everybody has one , and so on can always called somebody if there is a problem .
Also , any portable phone a connection to web , so it is easily said newspapers if one haven't enough money to buy .
Personally , the portable phone has affected my life , because when somebody is phoning at home I do n't have to rush to phone . because afraid that it 's too late .
I recommend this really great invention to those who still do n't a portable phones .

Time flies
I have to admit that whoever invented the cars and transportation vehicles did the most respectable invention of the world .
I say that it must be the most important thing in us because who save our time pass so fast .
Can you deny about to we get anywhere by car or by bus .
Maybe 10 time as quickly as have anywhere own .
Try to imagine your life without have anyof .
would be unbarable and painful .
Ceartainly would be like mine .
because I live in a rural area away from is village , town , or city centre .
The next civilization is me 1 hour own .
I have no car no local bus services used .
even comeing to Basingstoke seems like a International trip to .
and ofcause this stops me every time living sociable .
But also I aware of that the flies for me . I had do whatever I want before it is too late .
And I have to confess the invention of the car was a good invention for man .

Best Regards ,
My fair Mobile Phone .
The technological revolution claim today can be directly linked to amazing evolution our communications skills throughout that last few years .
The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspects in our ordinary life is , of course , a mobile phone .
It is clear and irrefutable the a this invention has became a necessary conditions some professional activities .
Trades ; politicians and taxi driver 's are but one examples such them .
The average man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone became when in hand of high school students .
It becomes that a real obsession for average students as e use before lessons . during lessons of lunch and , especially in examinations .
However , it is also a common mistake of believe that the sole purpose of such usage to communication news during an exam , and the major performance is actually to allowed the students and parents to talk in our everyday courses .
Bottom line is is teachers complaining about this situation will confiscate not students ' phone . but his parents !

Well , I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you live deep in a forest or in a dessert !
If you think how many computer we use every day and about dependent we are on them , it must be clear that invention of computer has certainly had significant impact on all our lives .
For example , all infrastructures such as transport and energy stations are ran using computers government use to organised all sorts of things a country , and all children of service and businesses such as hospitals and supermarkets use them as essential capitals .
In other words , almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers .
So I am sure from this that it is convincing to say invention of computers is really important .
From my personal experience I also say a personal computer is an amazing tool .
it advances productivity of homework and is often essay writing and also it allows me to access to the Internet .
Since I world to , the Internet is really useful for me to contact my best friend and know what is going on in a countries .
To sum up , I can say that the best every invention is invention of computer that has affected both indivisuals and out as a full .

The telephone . a blessing .
who of you will imagine life without the telephone ?
The being able to called your friends and ask if you can pop at a moment ?
The being able to lie a mother - in - law and demand you could n't was her garden party because of the illness , with having to look her our ?
when Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone . he had no idea how popular would be one day .
Its first appliances was to play a concert if you were not able to was in person .
Now , However , the whole world is connected by telephone system and no one will imagine life without .
Take me for example , I use it whenever there is a problems and I need some advice , or when I called from a meeting for any .
I can not only walk to the people and tell the Sorry , I had cancel our meeting " , because before it 's too later however , is n't it ?
Life definitely would n't be the same without invention of the telephone .
we use it day in order to get information or spending it on .
just trying to spend one weeks without using a telephone at all . and you will see that it is impossible to do so .
So do n't take the telephone for guaranteed but keep in mind that our modern way of life is frequently due to its invention .

A inventions are not regarded as great things even over the life without them should not be imagine .
people do not have the impression on important inventions anymore . because they have was more popular and average .
However , there is something which is are believe that it was an extreamly great invention .
. This is electricity invented by Edison .
In my opinion the reason because electricity is such important invention is that most of machines ; appliances and equipment which are used in modern time can be operated with only electricity , which makes people not to too much phisical labour .
What is more , may inventions have accelerated by electricity .
In my life , I used electricity in many different ways .
On night , I can study because it and and It saves time which will be was up doing housework such as laundry , clean rooms and ironing .
It makes my life more convenient than that without .
To sum up , although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention anymore . that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not change .

Many TV programmes are especially given to children , such as the Learn following me " and " Are good to other "
Actually , they are quite good programmes and help me know what I should general and how to an nicely when I was still a children .

The Olympique Museum is situated near the like and often , for tourists , an incredible view on the mountains and lake .
But also the museum have a lot of gardens with several statues .
Also , the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern .
First of all , the the take of museum is the olympic history .
You can find a lot of documentary about it and you several competitors personal objects .
In addition , you can play with several interactive game and learn the rules of olympic games .
REASONS OF RECOMMENDATION .
The principal reason is cheapest price .

Nowadays people have was was watch televesion 's programmes every day .
The TV is so important that you can see it every family and it is a essential equipment for everyone .
First of all , in my opinion TV has great education functions , and also made the world was small .
You can have sitting home when you can get what is happening all over the world at the moment .
I would rather watching the news on TV in instead of leading in the newspaper or hearing on radio because news on TV are vivid .
Moreover , TV is a great companies for all the people who lives alone or have alone . I would like to open TV I stay at home .
Someone are making ; laughting ; crying on there , so join them you will feel much better than have yourself .
A TV programmes are enjoyable !
The TV and has some disadvantages .
You might just sitting at TV hours study anything . or not talked with your family .
I think this is the badest influence on society .
in clucsion the TV has both advantages and disagvangtages , but on the full advantage is more than disadvantages .
So , but on the whole , TV are is a wonderful and great invention in the world .

For instance , I want to contanct with to my friend it 's almost help by using e - mail .
First computer had invented , we could n't possible have lots of news easily and we could n't contact to foreign country at the same time .
And also it time to new , which makes us used easier and more simple , because more people can enjoy computer rather than .
Despite amazing invention , sometimes computer made big problem : millennium bug ( some people called " 2000 problems the ) and computer not flexible enough like people 's brain .
The computer is worth use life for for coveniance machine will be invented .

The telephone a very important invention
In my earlier childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a little girl that has only telephone in the house where she lived .
It has been in her parents appartement .
The neighbours went on to the called and to get the called .
Todays nobody could imagined such a situation .
in every home there is a telephone by .
There are a lot of advantage .
First people able to talk to people on every . Are it : just for fun or also to talk some important and relevant thins .
Also we always can call to help the police , to the hospital or a doctor .
this could save life !
Another advantage is that all offices ; firms and industries will not further your without it .
Of course there is also a team disadvantage .
All people know this experience ; people want not interrupted . Maybe are reading a book , having a good told or are small sleep . then telephone rings ... !
It is not an easy decision to react now .
Being sincere . Most of us would go telephone .
Another thing of disadvantage is that mobile phones are ringing . everywhere on every .
The youngsters misuse this kind of invention .
To sum up this invention is one of the most need .
It is always at the same to people use it or not and how people handle .

It is widely out lots of different and important things were invented the 20th century , nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computers .
It is a fact that modern out has created the demand for ability to cope with the vast numbers of information .
Taking this I would like to say the computer is the priceless invention for an accountants ; designers ; engineers and so on and .
Another thing in favour is opportunity to connect to the Internet .
it is you have all necessary news " on a fingertips "
The not least importantly is role of computer in the process of production in factories around the world .
Also there are some disadvantages .
For instance a lot of children now replaced the real life the virtual world which computer .
another drawback is that in industry computer replaced people labour which lead to increase of unemployment .
To conclude I would like to say the goverments of developed countries would n't have been so concerned about so - called the problems 2000 " If computer was not so important for modern society .
